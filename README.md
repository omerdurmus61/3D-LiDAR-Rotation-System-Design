# 3D-LiDAR-Rotation-System-Design
The 3D LIDAR Rotation System enhances the capabilities of a limited-angle 3D LIDAR sensor by incorporating a servo motor-based electromechanical system. This setup enables data acquisition from previously unreachable angles, producing high-resolution point cloud data for environmental modeling and mapping.The scanning angle of the MRS 1000 3D LIDAR sensor from SICK is not sufficient to generate a high-resolution point cloud map. Therefore, I designed an electromechanical system that rotates the LIDAR around the y-axis. After that step, i developed a ROS package for that system. As a result, the system was able to obtain different point clouds from various areas of the environment. An external IMU was used to track the orientation of the platform. There is a real-time digital twin on RViz.
