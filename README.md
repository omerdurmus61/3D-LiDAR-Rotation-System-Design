# 3D-LiDAR-Rotation-System-Design
The 3D LIDAR Rotation System enhances the capabilities of a limited-angle 3D LIDAR sensor by incorporating a servo motor-based electromechanical system. This setup enables data acquisition from previously unreachable angles, producing high-resolution point cloud data for environmental modeling and mapping.
